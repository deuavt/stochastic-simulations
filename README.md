# stochastic-simulations

Small Monte Carlo simulations exploring phenomena in probability and stochastic processes.

Each script is a self-contained experiment that:
- Defines a form of probabilistic model.
- Simulates it computationally.
- Visualizes or outputs the result to the user.

This repository is intended as a computational companion to studies in probability and stochastic theory.
